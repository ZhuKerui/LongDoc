The crew was convinced of the reality of this paradise and saw it as a pristine and pure world. However, there was a two-legged serpent named Old Serpent, who lived in a big cave and spoke to his underlings about the crew's impending return. Old Serpent was planning to overhaul the blasters and was using the idea of a perfect paradise to lure settlers to spoil and mar it, taking advantage of the human desire to befoul the unspoiled. Old Serpent had changed some lines in his sales pitch to ensure authenticity and acquire equipment for farming the new world on a shoestring.

      " Summary: The crew, consisting of Captain Stark, Gregory Gilbert, Wolfgang Langweilig, Casper Craig, and Father Briton, discovered a paradise-like world with two inhabitants, Adam and Eve. They were convinced that this was the original paradise and were hesitant to disturb it. The Old Serpent, also known as \"Snake-Oil Sam,\" was aware of the crew's arrival and was planning to overhaul his blasters to prepare for their return. He believed that humans have a natural desire to spoil and mar unspoiled things and intended to take advantage of this trait. Adam, the only inhabitant of the paradise, was a preternatural being with a perfect intellect and had been there for an unknown amount of time. He was perfectly happy but was taught that happiness could be lost and that sickness, aging, and death were properties of fallen nature. The crew was initially skeptical of Adam's story but was convinced by his intellect and the fact that they saw Earth-like creatures and plants on the paradise. The Old Serpent had been trying to lure settlers to the paradise with false advertisements and had been disappointed that there had been no well-equipped settlers for six weeks. He had changed some details in his advertisements to make them more authentic and appealing to potential settlers. The woman, Hawwah, did not speak during the crew's visit.\n",

      "Summary: The Old Serpent, also known as Snake-Oil Sam, was satisfied that the crew was returning because he believed that humans have a natural desire to spoil and mar unspoiled things. He took advantage of this trait by creating a paradise and enticing settlers to come and ruin it. The settlers' skepticism was dismissed as they were convinced of the paradise's reality, and even the tycoon, Casper Craig, agreed after seeing it. The Old Serpent also mentioned that it had been six weeks since they had received well-equipped settlers, indicating a consistent flow of settlers trying to claim the paradise.\n",
