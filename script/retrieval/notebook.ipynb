      "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kalashnikov designed the AK-47 after being wounded fighting for the Red Army NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The inventor of the Kalashnikov assault rifle apparently wrote to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church before he died expressing fears he was morally responsible for the people it killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mikhail Kalashnikov, who died last month aged 94, wrote a long emotional letter to Patriarch Kirill in May 2012, church officials say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he was suffering \"spiritual pain\" over the many deaths it caused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov had previously refused to accept responsibility for those killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Devilish desires' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysis The letter published by Izvestia provides a fascinating insight into the mind of the man who created Russia's most famous weapon. Mikhail Kalashnikov spent his career designing and perfecting assault rifles. More than 100 million Kalashnikovs have been sold worldwide. The gun brought Kalashnikov fame and a string of awards. But his letter to the Patriarch suggests that, towards the end of his life, Kalashnikov felt a degree of guilt - or \"spiritual pain\" as he puts it - for having invented a killing machine. It's unclear, though, how much of this he wrote himself. Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying she believes a priest helped her father compose the letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in a letter, published in Russia's pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia, he wrote: \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle claimed people's lives, then can it be that I... a Christian and an Orthodox believer, was to blame for their deaths?\" he asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The longer I live,\" he continued, \"the more this question drills itself into my brain and the more I wonder why the Lord allowed man to have the devilish desires of envy, greed and aggression\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The letter is typed on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper, and is signed with a wavering hand by the man who describes himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Kalashnikov, or AK-47, is one of the world's most familiar and widely used weapons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its comparative simplicity made it cheap to manufacture, as well as reliable and easy to maintain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is thought that more than 100 million Kalashnikov rifles have been sold worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov refused to accept responsibility for the many people killed by his weapon, blaming the policies of other countries that acquired it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Reuters Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin attended Kalashnikov's funeral in December NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, pride in his invention was tempered with sadness at its use by criminals and child soldiers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is painful for me to see when criminal elements of all kinds fire from my weapon,\" Kalashnikov said in 2008. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia Cyril Alexander Volkov, Press secretary for Russian Patriarch Kirill NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Defend his country NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his letter to Patriarch Kirill, Kalashnikov said that he first went into a church at the age of 91 and was later baptised. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says it is unclear how much of it he wrote himself. Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying she believes a priest helped her father compose the letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The press secretary for the Russian Patriarch, Cyril Alexander Volkov, told the paper the religious leader had received Kalashnikov's letter and had written a reply. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it,\" Mr Volkov was quoted as saying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov received many Russian state honours, including the Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labour, but made little money from his gun. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He died on 23 December after being admitted to hospital a month earlier with internal bleeding.\n",

      "In this Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2009 file photo Mikhail Kalashnikov, who invented the AK-47 assault rifle, attends festivities to celebrate his 90th birthday at the Kremlin in Moscow. (AP Photo/Natalia Kolesnikova, Pool, file) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mikhail Kalashnikov, designer of the legendary AK-47 assault rifle, turned to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church shortly before his death to express fears he was personally guilty for those it killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov, who died in December at the age of 94, in April wrote a lengthy emotional letter to Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill, Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, reported on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" he asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The typed letter on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper, reproduced by Izvestia, is signed with a wavering hand by the man who describes himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov, whose funeral was attended by President Vladimir Putin, came up with the durable and simple rifle design after experiencing the Red Army's dire lack of weapons during World War II. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now the AK-47 is widely manufactured unlicenced around the world and has become a visual hallmark of armed insurgent movements, including those using child soldiers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov wrote that he first went into a church at the age of 91 and was later baptised. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Patriarch's press secretary, Alexander Volkov, told Izvestia that the Russian Church leader received the letter and wrote a personal reply. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it,\" Volkov said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Russian Orthodox Church has sought to consolidate its new-found strength after the Soviet era by building up close ties with state agencies and powerful officials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Kalashnikov was feted by the Soviet authorities, it would have been unthinkable for him to have declared himself anything else than an atheist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His daughter, Yelena, told Izvestia: \"Of course you can't say he went to services or lived strictly according to the commandments. You have to understand his generation.\"\n",
